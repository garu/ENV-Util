=head1 NAME

ENV::Util - parse prefixed environment variables and dotnev (.env) files into Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Efficiently load a '.env' file into %ENV:

    use ENV::Util -load_dotenv;

Turn all %ENV keys that match a prefix into a lowercased config hash:

    use ENV::Util;

    my %cfg = ENV::Util::prefix2hash('MYAPP_');
    # MYAPP_SOME_OPTION becomes $cfg{ some_option }

Safe dump of %ENV without tokens or passwords:

    use ENV::Util;
    my %masked_env = ENV::Util::redacted_env();
    say $masked_env{token_secret}; # '<redacted>'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a set of utilities to let you easily handle environment
variables from within your Perl program.

It is lightweight, should work on any Perl 5 version and has no dependencies.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 prefix2hash( 'PREFIX' )

    my %config = ENV::Util::prefix2hash( 'MYAPP_' );

This function returns all data from environment variables that begin with
the given prefix. You can use that to allow users to control your program
directly from their environment without risking name clashing of env vars.

So for example if your app is called "MYAPP", you can allow them to setup
MYAPP_TOKEN, MYAPP_USERNAME, MYAPP_ROLES, MYAPP_TOKEN, etc. as environment
variables. By calling C<prefix2hash()> with the proper prefix (in this case,
'MYAPP_'), you get a hash of all the specified keys and values, with the
prefix properly stripped and all keys in lowercase, as is common practice
in Perl code.

=head2 load_dotenv()

=head2 load_dotenv( $filename )

This functions load the contents of any L<dotenv file|https://12factor.net/config>
(defaults to 'C<.env>') into %ENV. It does B<*NOT*> override keys/values already
in the environment (%ENV). To use a filename other than "C<.env>", simply pass
it as an argument.

    ENV::Util::load_dotenv();                # loads ".env"
    ENV::Util::load_dotenv('somefile.env');  # loads "somefile.env"

    # to load multiple files in a given order:
    ENV::Util::load_dotenv($_) for qw( file1.env file2.env file3.env );

B<NOTE:> because loading a C<.env> file is so common for apps running in
containers, we added a shortcut that loads it directly at compile time:

    use ENV::Util -load_dotenv;

=head2 redacted_env()

=head2 redacted_env( %options )

    $ENV{ HARMLESS_VAR } = 1234;
    $ENV{ APP_SECRET } = 4321;

    my %masked = ENV::Util::redacted_env();
    say $masked{ HARMLESS_VAR };  # 1234;
    say $masked{ APP_SECRET };    # <redacted>;

Returns a masked (redacted) version of %ENV, (hopefully) without sensitive information.
This can be useful if you are dumping your environment variables to a log/debug facility
without compromising information security/privacy.

B<WARNING>: This function is heuristic and redacts based on suspicious token/value data.
B<< There is NO WARRANTY that your sensitive data will be redacted >>. You are advised
to test and tweak options according to your environment and data, and use it at your
own discretion and risk.

Any keys matching the following will be redacted/masked: USER, ID, NAME,
MAIL, ACC, TOKEN, PASS, PW, SECRET, KEY, ACCESS, PIN, SSN, CARD, IP.

Regardless of keys, any I<values> that contain '@', ':' or '=' will also
be redacted.

=head3 Creating your own mask/redaction rules:

To override the following rules with your own, simply pass to the function a
hash with a C<rules> key, holding an array reference of hash references
containing each rule. The format is as follows:

    my %masked_env = ENV::Util::redacted_env(
        rules => [
            { key => qr(...), mask => '<redacted>' },
            { key => qr( another key ), drop => 1 },
        ],
    );

As you can see above, each rule is a hash reference that may contain the
following fields:

=over 4

=item * C<key> is a regexp to be tested against %ENV keys.

=item * C<value> is a regexp to be tested against %ENV values.

=item * C<mask> is what to replace the value with. Default to C<undef>.

=item * C<drop> if set to true, removes the matching key entirely.
